    "# Project 1: My First Jupyter Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary that holds information concerning NDSU AAE Faculty\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is a dictionary in Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do I make one?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a data structure that stores data objects that linked to keys. Data objects can be numbers (integers or floats), string (\"text in quotations\"), data frames, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "What are keys?: Keys are inputs that link to a particular output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I make a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an outline on how to define a dictionary \"dct\", in two different ways. The first lists the terms and then later adds more information to each term. The second example is the NDSU AAE Faculty dictionary that lists information as each term is introduced. The two ways use the [] and {} differently, although I am not sure why (yet). I prefer the second way. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is \"import pandas\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Import pandas as .pd is used to to import a \"dct\" as a dataframe, which is basically a table. By giving each name certain qualitities like profession or interesting fact, the table can automatically assign the information to the correct rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question: How to get a data frame saved as a CSV?\n",
    "\n",
    "The homework assignment sparks this question for me, as I doubt \"file save as\" is going to do it. A simple google search might do it if today's lecture doesn't get quite that far.\n",
    "\n",
    "-update the code is as follows: df.to_csv('file_name.csv')\n"
